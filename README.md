# Overview
This is a Data Engineering Toolkit, a collection of reuseable scripts for common data engineering tasks.
This repository is designed to be a starting point for cleaning, transforming and loading data.



# Documentation
The main documentation for each script can be found within the files themselves, using detailed comments and docstrings. Each script is designed to be self-explanatory, with clear function definitions.

- [Data Cleaning Script](clean_data.py): Function for cleaning raw data.  
- [Data Transformation Script](transform_data.py): Function for applying transformation to data.  
- [Data Loading Script](load_data.py): Functions for writing processed data to various CSV or JSON file formats.
